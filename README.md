# Event Modeling for PlantUML
PlantUML macros and other includes for Event Modelling

## Background
### PlantUML
[PlantUML](http://en.plantuml.com/) is an open source project that allows you to create UML diagrams.
Diagrams are defined using a simple and intuitive plain text language. It uses [Graphviz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz) software to lay out its diagrams. Images can be generated in PNG, in SVG or in LaTeX format.

### Event Modeling
[Event Modeling](https://eventmodeling.org/) is a method of describing systems using an example of how information has changed within them over time. 

[Here](https://eventmodeling.org/posts/what-is-event-modeling/) is a good place to understand how it works.
